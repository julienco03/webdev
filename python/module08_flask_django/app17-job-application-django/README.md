# What is this project?
This django app allows you to use a simple job application form just like with the [Flask app](https://github.com/julienco03/webdev/tree/main/python/module08_flask_django/app16-job-application-flask).  

One of the biggest differences is the admin panel, which comes by default with Django and provides many functionalities.

The coolest feature is that you can directly edit data from the database:

However, it is worth mentioning that django is much more powerful but also more complex than Flask.
